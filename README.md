# Background
Joining networking event or party indeed fun and enjoying, provided you're not getting drunk. Drunk driving has already contributed most of the road accidents, while recently drunk rape cases becoming more popular too. 
HangOver is an mobile app which aim to solve all these problems by leveraging APIs such as Uber API, Twilio API and IntroMI API. Our users not only getting an enhanced feature events app (MeetUp & Eventbrite) and also feel safe to join alcohol event with a group of strangers. Our app provide functionalities to allow other participant of the event to help you grab a taxi, notify your next-in-kind as well as send you back home (or maybe hospital? opss :p)
